/*DESTRUCTIVE ASSIGN =>Destructuring assignment is a cool feature that came along with ES6. 
Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, 
or properties from objects, into distinct variables. That is, we can extract data from arrays 
and objects and assign them to variables.*/
